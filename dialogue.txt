Intro:

Guide: Welcome! What's your name?

[Enter name]

Tom Nook: Well, well, well, if it isn't [player]! You’ve got quite the problem on your hands.

[Player]: What do you mean?

Tom Nook: Don’t you remember the big fancy island house you bought? Now you owe me 50,000 bells! And I want my money NOW!


[Player]: 50,000 bells? How on earth am I supposed to pay that?!


Tom Nook: I don’t know, figure it out! Go fishing, catch some bugs, and harvest fruit trees. Just get me my money!


Guide: To pay off your debt, you'll need to earn bells by selling items you collect throughout the island. Good luck, [player]!


Tom Nook's Office:


If the player has enough bells:


Mr. Resett5i: Well, be, you actually paid off your debt [Player]! I guess you're not as useless as I thought. Congratulations, the island house is all yours now. Now scram you rascal!


If the player doesn't have enough bells:


Tom Nook: What? You don’t even have enough money! Get back out there and earn more bells! I want my money, [player], and I want it now!


Store:
Tommy : Welcome to Nook’s Cranny! I'm Tommy, and this is Timmy.

If yes:


Tommy: Great, let’s see what you have!


[Transaction]


Tommy: Thanks for your business!
