What are some ideas you guys have? Like for the theme of the game

animal crossing kind of game (theme) 
3 diff “tasks” for player  to complete to pay off certain amount of money to Mr. Resetti 
Fishing minigame
Bug Catching
Fruit Harvesting
Roles/Responsibilities
Bug class (alex)
Fruit class (ezzah) 
Fish class (danielle)
Diving for sea creatures (heather)
Room class/menu (alex)
Character class (ludun)
narrative/text writing (ezzah (and tba(?)))
Uml (tba)
General Concept:
Introduction of theme/game, where you speak with Mr. Resetti (prolly just a back and forth text convo, add function/method for letters typed individually) 
Basically resetti tells player that they have to pay a debt to him, and until that debt is paid, their home will become a maze instead of their usual home 
Player finds themself at their home (Menu Class)
They get to choose in the menu to play any of the minigames or talk to mr resetti
Bug catching minigame (Most money)
Fish Minigame (Medium Money)
Fruit Harvesting (Least Money)
Talk to Mr Resetti
If you have enough to pay off your debt (Win Condition)
If you don’t have enough money you have to go back to playing games
Minigame class breakdown 
- name of bug/sea creature/fruit/fish
- money amount (currency name is leaves) 
- catchphrase presented when caught (located in the links danielle sent in the discord gc)
